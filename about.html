          <p class="about-body">
            My name is Brittany. I am a mother, wife and aspiring entrepreneur.
            I have two beautiful children and a loving husband who inspire me
            everyday. I have always had a love for growing things and being
            outdoors (although I despise creepy crawlies). My love for growing
            things comes from my grandmothers, I believe. They planted a seed in
            me and I hope to do the same with my children and their children. I
            work everyday to get a little closer to my dream of having a fully
            operating farm. We currently own a home on a 1/3 acre suburban lot.
            Its enough garden space (for now) but we will have acreage above and
            beyond my wildest dreams, I just know it! So here I am, growing my
            veggies, tending to my plant starts and loving on my little
            Orpington hens. I offer what I have grown with love & from love to
            my local community. I aim to maintain transparency no matter where
            and how much my little homestead may grow. I know you wonâ€™t regret
            supporting my cause and efforts.
